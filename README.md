## Feature Request
This is a pre-release version of the RCWA part of our unified python library MaxPy. It is minimal in a sense there is no support for different sources and geometries. We are working to improve it. Feel free to submit a feature request through the following two ways:

1. open an issue on GitHub.
2. email ziweizhu95@gmail.com for any feedbacks or requests.

We would try to add new features in the MaxPy. 

The library only depends on numpy and PyTorch, although drawing figures requires the installation of matplotlib.
